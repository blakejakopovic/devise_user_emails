== Details

I am currently working on a project where users can have multiple emails 
linked to their account. The specs are as follows:
* Users can have multiple emails
* Users have one primary email
* Users register with a single email only (can add more later)
* Users can add emails on edit page
* Users can login using any linked email
* Users can modify primary email (using radio input of existing emails)
* Emails must be confirmed (via clicking link in a confirmation email)
* Emails must all be validated correctly (regex)
(optional) Users can login using a username (if we get around to it)

Therefore, these are the things that we need to change:
* Schema
* * Create user_emails table
* * Create indexes
* * Remove :users, :email column
* Users model
* * include has_many emails
* * add an email instant method to return primary email
* Sessions Controller
* * Update form (to support emails association; if required)
* * Update create method to support multiple email association
* Registrations Controller
* * Update validation to work for multiple emails
* * Update edit action (to allow editing multiple emails and selecting primary email)
* * Email confirmation (sending an email with confirm link)
* Test Coverage
* I am unsure at this point

My underlying knowledge off devise inner workings is a bit limited and I 
am also yet to achieve rails mastery, however I am willing to contribute 
and test as much as I can.

If you are willing to contribute, in any way, please reply and we will see 
if we can't get the basics completed asap. Thanks for your help.
